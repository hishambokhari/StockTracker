Finance Tracker App

- Story:

You are a rising star in the start-up.
CEO came up with an idea for an app which will be presented in an investors gathering in a few days.
With your experience of building a few web applications already, you've been tasked with building this app within the next 2-3 days.


# Requirements:

- Authentication system, users can sign-up, edit their profile, login/logout
- Users can track stocks, up to 10 per user. Their profile page will display all the stocks they are tracking with their current price.
- Users can search for stocks, add and remove stocks from their portfolio
- Users can look for friends, or other users of the app, by name or email
- Users can view the portfolio of stocks their friends are tracking for investing ideas
- The app must be mobile friendly, so styling has to be responsive.


# Restrictions or Constraints:

- Requires fast development
- Styling needs to be nice and presentable
- No test framework required since its a prototype and the aim is to get the product up and running to display at the investors meeting
- Core functionality, time and presentation are key factors
